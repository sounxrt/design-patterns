## Structural Design Patterns

Design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities (objects and classes). 

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adapter   | Translates the interface of one class into another interface.                                                                                       |
| Bridge    | Used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client program.                                  |
| Composite | Helps you to create treee structures of objects without the need to force clients to differentialte between brances and leaves regarding usage.     |
| Decorator | Lets you attach additional responsibilities and modify an instance functionality dynamically.                                                       |
| Facade    | Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.                                                                                 |
| Flyweight | Provides a mechanism by which you can avoid creating a large number of expensive objects and instead reuse existing instance to represent new ones. |
| Proxy     | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.                                                                      |
