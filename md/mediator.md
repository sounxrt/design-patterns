# Mediator

With the mediator pattern communication between objects is encapsulated with a mediator object. 

Objects no longer communicate directly with eachother, but instead communicate through the mediator.

## When to use?

The Mediator pattern can be used when a set of objects communicate in well-specified but complex ways and the resulting interdependencies are unstructured and hard to grasp

## Benefits

- The mediator abstracts object cooperation.

## Drawbacks

- The mediator pattern trades complexity of interaction for complexity in the mediator.
